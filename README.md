# Block-2

The purpose of this repository is to provide a backend for spreadsheet. It does this by taking in a location on where the update is (A12 or Z1). It also takes in three different options with that position. First one is text which places the text at the location provided. The second one is math which needs to be formated in a certain way. The format needs to start with an = then have a valid equation at the end. If the equation is not valid then a string Not Valid will be returned if correct then will return the answer to the number (=12+5) is valid (=13//2) is not valid. The third format is using equations while also using information at certain location of the spreadsheet. For example =A1 - A2 would take the first and second A Column rows then subtract using what ever information is in them. If the equation is not valid because of the things inside the location the backend will return not valid. If valid the backend will return the correct answer.
